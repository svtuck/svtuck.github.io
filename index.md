I am a Sr. Software Engineer at Amazon working on Alexa. I've been a part of ML Infrastructure teams working on scaling ML; scaling with data and scaling with concurrent ML scientists. This work culminated in leading the model building work for [Alexa Skills Kit](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00549). I spent time in Cambridge, UK working on Alexa Information and was the lead on the integration of an acquisition, Graphiq, as a Q&A source in Alexa. Recently I've been working on arbitration between parallel heterogenous NLU systems.  For Fall of 2019 I am on sabbatical from Amazon and am teaching in the CS department at [Carleton College](https://www.carleton.edu/computer-science/).

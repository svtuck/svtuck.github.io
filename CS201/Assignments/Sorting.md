# Sorting

This assignment is to be done individually, without a partner. You may share ideas with others in the class, but you should turn in your own assignment. Turn in your answers electronically.


1. On paper sort 3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6 using quicksort with a pivot in the first position.
2. Suppose that you have an array of n elements, containing only two distinct keys, true and false. Give an O(n) algorithm to rearrange the list so that all false elements precede the true elements. You may use only constant extra space.
3. The choice of pivot for quicksort can dramatically affect its performance. Some common choices are:
	- The first element
	- The middle element
	- A randomly selected element
	- The median element of the array
	- The median element of the first three elements in the array
	Comment on each of the above choices. What are the pros and cons of each? Under what situations are they good or bad ideas?
4. On paper sort 451, 335, 653, 922, 10, 354, 553 using radix sort

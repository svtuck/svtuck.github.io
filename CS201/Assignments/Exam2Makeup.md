# Exam 2 Makeup

I am making a makeup option available for exam 2. The option is to write Java programs for each of the 8 point questions:

- Ancient Multiplication
- Removing Duplicates from a doubly linked list of integers (should include both addition and the remove duplicate method)
- Hashing with chaining/double hashing (does not need table doubling, but should have a sensible toString that shows the state of the table)

You should have a complete main method that includes example usage: i.e. call ancientMultiply with some examples, add stuff and remove from a doubly linked list, add the examples to the hash table and print the table.

This will be a "soft" adjustment: I will not change the score in my spreadsheet but it will impact the final grades I assign.

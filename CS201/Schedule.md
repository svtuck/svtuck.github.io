# CS 201

This is a rough schedule, subject to change. Unless otherwise noted, assignments are due at 10 p.m. on the day listed. The readings are not generally long, and I expect them to be done before class. To reinforce this, you are expected to post a question or comment (or answer to another question) from the reading prior to 8 am on moodle (this is part of your course grade). This will also help me focus the class.

| Class # 	| Date           	| Topics             	| Assigned Reading                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           	| Assignment Due at 10 p.m. 	|

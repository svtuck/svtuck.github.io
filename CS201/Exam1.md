# Exam 1

For this exam you will be allowed a hand written 8.5 x 11 sheet of paper. You won't be asked to turn it in.

## Topics
Anything from the first three weeks is fair game (non-exhaustive):
- Java basics (data types, references, loops, conditionals)
- Polymorphism and Inheritance (interfaces, sub/superclasses, casting, generics)
- Abstract Data Types
- Bags (LinkedBags and ArrayBags and what the pros and cons are)
- Big Oh (The main classes: O(1), O(log(n)), O(n) ... O(n!) and their orders, formal definitions and choose an C and k)
- Stacks
- Queues


## What we won't cover
- Recursion (next week)
- Reading files
- Reading from the command line
- Exceptions (try/catch)
- Generating random numbers
- Regurgitating the implementation we did in class from scratch

## How we might ask it
- T/F questions on things like java and big oh
- Proof questions on big oh (choose C and k)
- Will this compile (for polymorphism and data types)?
- What is the output of this code snippet (for java and references)?
- Modify an implementation to do something new (what if we wanted to add a "size" variable to track the size in the LinkedBag we did? what if we want to add some new operation to a stack like pushAll()?)
- Fill in an implementation we skimmed over in class
- Correct a buggy implementation I provide

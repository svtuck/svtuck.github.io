# Python to Java
For this assignement the task is to run both the python and the java versions of each of these programs. Do this twice, once on a lab computer (to make sure you have access and everything is working, do this even if you are intending to use a personal computer most of the time) and once on your personal computer (if you are going to use it for class).

"Turn in" a question or comment to the moodle forum. If you run into any issues reach out to myself or Mike Tie (mtie@carleton.edu, for roadblocks with lab computers).

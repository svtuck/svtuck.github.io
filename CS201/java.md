# Install Java and an IDE

## Install Java
1. Go to the open jdk [downloads page](https://jdk.java.net/12/).
2. Download the appropriate file from the list.
3. Follow instructions from [here](https://openjdk.java.net/install/) to unpack

On mac, you can alternatively use [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) and [adoptopenjdk](https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/homebrew-openjdk).

## Install an IDE


### Install jGRASP
1. Visit jgrasp.org, and click the Download link on the top-left side of the screen.
2. Optionally, fill out your user information.
3. Download the appropriate installer below the survey, depending on which operating system you are running. You'll have to choose which version of jGRASP to download. The version numbers keep changing so its hard to keep these instructions precise, but usually they offer too versions: a bleeding-edge prerelease. Download the more stable release, which is likely the second one. There aren't any new features that will matter for what we're doing, and it will make more sense for you to be using the better-tested version.
4. Install it as you would any other application.

### Install IntelliJ
1. Visit [jetbrains.com](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=mac)
2. Download and install COMMUNITY EDITION.
